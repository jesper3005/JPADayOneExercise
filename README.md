# JPADayOneExercise

Exercise - JPA Entity Mappings -1

These exercises will investigate some of the more useful Object-Entity mappings available in JPA. You should,
however, be aware of that the amount possible annotations are enormous. 
For this exercise, we will create the tables from the Entity classes and use JPA’ CONVENTION-OVER-CONFIGURATION strategy 
to let JPA do most of the work.  In the end, however, you should create a new project and create entity classes from the tables
generated by this exercise. This will show you a great deal of those annotations we haven’t used (because we are using default values)
